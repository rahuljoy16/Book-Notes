    <h1>👋 About This Project</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Book Notes</strong> — a minimalist place to keep track of what I've read, reflect on key insights, and rate what truly made an impact.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/book" target="_blank">Derek Sivers' legendary book notes</a>, this site is my personal attempt to capture the highlights from every book I read.
    </p>

    <p>
        You’ll find short notes, my personal takeaways, and a rating that reflects how impactful or memorable I found the book.
    </p>

    <h2>📚 Why Book Notes?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To remember more from what I read</li>
        <li>To reflect and build connections between ideas</li>
        <li>To share useful takeaways with others</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Built with ❤️ using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, EJS, and a touch of CSS.
